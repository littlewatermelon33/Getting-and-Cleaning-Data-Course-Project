# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The script is invented to analyze the data from UCI HAR Dataset. It's supposed that archive is extracted to the working directory.

The following files from the initial dataset is used:

features.txt - includes the descriptions for features measured
train/X_train.txt - includes the measurements of the features in train set (one row - 1 measurement of 561 features)
test/X_test.txt - includes the measurements of the features in test set
train/subject_train.txt - subject for each measurement from the train set
test/subject_test.txt - subject for each measurement from the test set
train/y_train.txt - activity (from 1 to 6) for each measurement from the train set
test/y_test.txt - activity (from 1 to 6) for each measurement from the test set
